# Second Countability
```ad-note
title:
A topo space $X$ is called second countable if $\exists$ a ctble basis $\mathcal{B}$ on X that generates $\tau_X$.
```

# Related Problems
1) Find a 2nd ctble space which has a quotient that's not 2nd ctble.
   #### Example:
   Take the equiv relation $x \sim y$ iff $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ or $x=y$. This is not first countable hence not 2nd countable. Not first countable around the point $[0]$ in $\mathbb{R}/\sim$.
